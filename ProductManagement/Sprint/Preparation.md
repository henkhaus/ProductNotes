#Preparing for the Sprint


###Set the stage
* Choose a big challenge.
> Use sprints when the stakes are high, when there's not enough time, or when you're just plain stuck.
* Get a Decider (or two).
> Without a Decider, decisions won't stick. If the Decider cant make The Who sprint, appoint a delegate.
* Recruit a sprint team.
> Seven or fewer. Get diverse skills along with people who work on the project day-to-day.
* Schedule extra experts.
> Interview these people Monday afternoon for 15-20 minutes each, totaling about 2 hours.
* Pick a facilitator.
> This person manages time, conversations, and the overall sprint process. Need to be able to lead a meeting and synthesize discussions on the fly.
* Block 5 full days on the calendar.
> 9 to 5 each day.
* Use a room with at least two whiteboards.
> This is a must have. 

#### Key Ideas
* No distractions: No laptops, phones, or tablets allowed. If you need a device, leave the room or wait for a break.
* Timer: A tight schedule builds confidence in the sprint process. Use a timer to create focus and sense of urgency.
* Lunch: Lunch will be at 12:30 for one hour.
