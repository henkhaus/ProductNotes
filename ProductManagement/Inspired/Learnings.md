#### Overarching Principle

We need to build teams of missionaries not teams of mercenaries

#### Product Team


###### Principles of Success

* Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end
* Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially. Collaboration builds effective teams
* Its about solving problems, not implementing features
* Teams are able to try and solve problems they are assigned in the best way they see fit
* Teams need to understand business context and overall objectives
* Teams must feel ownership and responsibility for their outcome 


##### Composition

The typical product team
* 2 to 8-12 Developers (Practical upper bound uses ‘two pizza’ rule)
* UI/UX Designer
* Product Manager

This cross functional team is not about reporting relationships
* Each function will usually report to functional managers (Engineering manager, Head of design, Head of product)


##### Activities

Discovery
* Discovery is the intense collaboration between PM, UI/UX, and Developer with the goal to quickly separate good from bad ideas. The output of discovery is a validated product backlog.
* We answer these questions
  * Will the user buy or choose to use this?
  * Can the user figure out how to use this?
  * Can we build this?
  * Can we support this?
* Discovery is experimentation through rapid prototyping techniques. These require at least an order of magnitude less time and effort than building the product. (MVP – minimum viable prototype)

Delivery
* Delivery is the building and release of products by the team. The output of delivery are products that achieve product/market fit, something we can sell and run a business on.
* Delivery is a key step in delivering on our product vision.


* We need to discover the product to be built, and we need to deliver that product to clients/market
* These activities occur in parallel – every member of the team has some level of input to both discovery and delivery.


##### Roles

Product Manager
* Responsible for evaluating opportunities
* Determines what gets built and delivered to customers
* Makes sure what goes into the product backlog is worth building
* Knowledge of the customer, data, the business, the market and industry

Designer
* Creates high fidelity prototypes while considering overall product UX
* Responsible for user testing with prototypes to determine the right product
* Responsible for visual and interaction design (which informs functionality)

Developer
* Responsible for building
* Determines best technical architecture for given problem 
* Involved with discovery with the PM


##### Leadership

CTO
* Leader of the technology organization
* Responsible for holistic system implementation
* Leader of engineering (Developers, SDLs)

Head of Product
* Responsible for building skills of product managers
* Highly accessible and critical resource to product managers, designers, developers, and testing/QA staff.
* Leader of PMs and Design organization
* Peer to CTO

Principal Designer
* Leader of the design team
* Responsible for the holistic product design
* Typically reports to Head of Product

#### Multi-team Structure and Strategy

Team deployment strategy should reflect investment strategy

Minimize dependencies
* This helps teams move faster and feel more autonomous

Facilitate ownership and autonomy
* “missionaries not mercenaries”
* Teams should feel empowered, yet accountable

Maximize Leverage
* Create shared services to increase speed and reliability
* Don’t reinvent the wheel

Product vision and strategy
* Should be clear and communicated often
* Teams should be set up to deliver on this

Team size - no more than 8-12

Align with Architecture, User, and Business
* Architecture drives technology, which drives skill sets
* Larger and common user stories can define team structure
* Structure is a moving target
* Needs will change over time


#### Product Roadmaps

Why do we have roadmaps?
* Management wants to work on highest business value first
* Management needs to make date-based decisions and commitments

Traditionally a top-down approach
* How can we improve?
* The empowered product team is equipped with the best ways to solve business problems assigned to them but need business context to execute properly.

Business context is provided by management and includes
* Properly communicated product vision and strategy
* Prioritized business objectives (what we need to accomplish and how results will be measured)

Providing this to teams leads to management prioritizing business results rather than product ideas.

This also shifts focus to the teams for making high integrity date-based commitments to management
* This enriches “missionaries not mercenaries” concept
* This focuses teams on outcome, not output

The result is a business focused, accurate product roadmap.


#### Product Vision

Effective product vision starts with why – articulate purpose

Fall in love with the problem, not with the solution

Think big with vision – greater than a year out in order to inspire

Disrupt yourself – or someone else will

Determine and embrace relevant and meaningful trends – build product to leverage trends

Skate where the puck is heading, not to where it is – identify that things are changing

Be stubborn on vision but flexible in the details

Any product vision is a leap of faith – if you can fully validate your vision, it isn’t ambitious enough

Evangelize continuously and relentlessly

Product vision drives product strategy



### Tools for the Product Manager

#### Product Evangelism

Use a prototype

Share the pain – take devs to customers

Share the vision

Share learnings generously

Share credit generously

Learn how to give a great demo

Do your homework – know the business

Be genuinely excited

Show enthusiasm

Spend time with the team


#### Product Discovery

Purpose
* Will the user choose to use this? (value risk)
* Can the user figure out how to use it? (usability risk)
* Can we build it? (feasibility risk)
* Does this solution work for our business? (viability risk)

The following can help drive how we discover
* We cant solely on customers for ideation – they don’t know what is possible
* Establish compelling value for customers
* Expect that many ideas wont work out
* Validate ideas on customers and Analytics Team
* Evaluate feasibility and viability during discovery, not after
* Our goal is to validate ideas in the fastest, cheapest way possible

#### Discovery Techniques

##### Idea Validation

Opportunity Assessment
* What business objective does this address? (objective)
* How will you know if we are successful? (key results)
* What problem does this solve for our customers? (customer problem)
* What type of customer are we focused on? (target market)

Customer Interviews
* Are the customers who we think they are?
* Do they have the problems we think they have?
* How is the problem solved today?
* What is required to switch?

Concierge testing – do their job

Hack Days
* Goal for the PM - Quickly get a range of high potential ideas.
* Goal for the teams are for self-organizing groups to develop some form of prototype that can be evaluated
* Directed – with a customer problem
* Undirected – explore any idea related to vision
* Supports ‘missionaries not mercenaries’ concept

Prototyping

Feasibility prototype – write just enough code to assess feasibility

User prototype – high and low fidelity 

Principles
* Learn something at much lower cost
* Force thought of the idea at a deeper level
* Develop shared understanding within the team
* Develop lowest fidelity to get job done
* Answer product risk questions (value, usability, feasibility, viability)
* Can act as spec in future when coupled with business rules and acceptance criteria
